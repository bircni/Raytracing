# Raytracing

This is the main repository for the raytracing project.

## `log` crate

> Usage:  
> The basic use of the log crate is through the five logging macros: `error!`, `warn!`, `info!`, `debug!` and `trace!` where `error!` represents the highest-priority log messages and trace! the lowest. The log messages are filtered by configuring the log level to exclude messages with a lower priority. Each of these macros accept format strings similarly to println!.
